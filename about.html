<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #cccccc;">My name is Parker, I go by "MHFsilver" or Silver</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #cccccc;">I'm from Portland, Oregon</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #cccccc;">Growing up I always had an interest in&nbsp;architectural design and when I was in school, that's what I took classes on. That and some marketing and economics courses. Originally I had planned on attending college to get a degree in&nbsp;architectural design, but sadly couldn't get any funding to attend.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #cccccc;">In 2012, I began speedrunning. I began with speedrunning 16 Star in Super Mario 64, along with doing runs of the unreleased (at the time) Star Fox 2 done using the leaked ROMs. From there, I became a part of, and helped grow a community around speedrunning the Mega Man Battle Network/Star Force games. Our community would go on to become known as "TeamBN" which to this day, is known for doing charity events as well as assiting in fan projects.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #cccccc;">In 2015, I began competing in tournaments for the Nintendo game "Splatoon" along with other members of the site "SpeedRunsLive". We created a team together and played in many tournaments together, quickly becoming a well known and established team in the small scene. We'd go on to become one of the best teams in North America in late 2015 to early 2016 as we competed in worldwide events like the "EndGame Premiere Splatoon League".&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #cccccc;">In 2017, I created my own Splatoon team with my friends Bryan "alpaca837" and Angie "Redstarx33". Much like SpeedRunsLive, we quickly became a well known team as all of our members were previouslly well known players from various teams.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #cccccc;">In 2018, after playing in the LAN event "Don't Park on the Grass 2018" and placing 3rd, I took my leave from the competitive Splatoon scene. At this time, the team I had made had disbanded and the players went their own ways, I had been a free agent for months up until this point and decided not to continue following the LAN event.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #cccccc;">In 2020, I was picked up by "Supernova" to be the Splatoon manager and coach for their competitive Splatoon team. A team that was made up of people I had already known from the scene, and even one I had played with on my own team.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #cccccc;">Currently, I still speedrun in my free time, as well as coach Splatoon alongside my day job of working as a computer technician.</span></p>
